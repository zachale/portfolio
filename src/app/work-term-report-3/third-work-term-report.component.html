        &emsp; I spent my third work term as a software engineering intern at
        ApplyBoard. This was an exciting opportunity to work with a different company
        and I continued to be an independent contributor as part of their engineering team. I
        developed full-stack solutions to resolve client feedback, realize new
        product features, and fix critical bugs.

        I was contributing to ApplyBoard's platform for the duration of my internship.
        As a software engineering intern, I was tasked with building and
        maintaining full-stack features based on specifications and fixing
        critical bugs. These specifications could arise from direct customer or
        user feedback, a UI/UX designer, or a myriad of other stakeholders. To
        build these features I utilized modern web technologies which included
        technologies like Typescript, Angular, Express.Js, Jest, Node and
        MongoDB. I built robust, impactful features and solutions that accrued
        thousands of user impressions and fulfilled specifications.

        The most impactful project I developed in my third term was a critical
        race condition fix within their on-demand translation pipeline. After
        asking questions and understanding the root issue, I discovered that the
        given proposed solution was not scalable and would add unnecessary
        complexity. To mediate this, I advocated for and created a second
        solution that resolved the race condition directly. Because of my vocal
        advocacy, my solution was chosen and eventually proven most effective.
        One requirement for the solution was that functionality had to be
        maintained in highly concurrent and distributed situations. I validated
        this by completing several pair-testing sessions to trigger concurrent
        cloud functions. This project was an incredible learning opportunity and
        taught me the importance of advocating for my ideas. It also resulted in
        an estimated 90% reduction in peak on-demand translation costs.

        My third term at ApplyBoard was another unforgettable experience. The
        technical and professional skills I developed will prove invaluable as I
        continue my career in software engineering. I look forward to what the
        future has in store, and I am excited to apply my new skills in my next
        co-op term.

            After completing my second co-op term, I received feedback that I
            needed to work on my planning ability. My previous term at 10KC was
            the first time my technical planning skills came under stress so
            receiving that criticism was incredibly valuable and allowed me to
            make it a focus of my third term. I achieved this goal by being
            very purposeful with ticket scoping, ensuring that I understood the
            impact of each ticket. As someone who loves to work on the fly, it
            was a challenge to pause and fully map out each ticket before diving
            in. This was an effective strategy, and I feel much more confident
            in my planning ability. By using feedback as fuel, I developed my
            technical planning skills to the next level.

          <div class="text-body">
            Another area I wanted to improve my skills in this term was my
            testing ability. After reflecting on my previous terms, I realized that
            there were a handful of instances where anticipating the true impact
            of a small change was a challenge. For example, I wrote code for a
            small feature that was fully functional but missing a single
            character. Missing that one character caused a critical page to
            crash on production. This incident made it clear to me that I needed
            to have a full understanding of any side effects caused by my
            changes. I aimed to focus on reading testing files before changing
            functionality and ensuring at least a 90% test coverage on all new
            functionality created. I dramatically achieved this goal and wrote
            high-coverage testing for almost every single feature I built in my
            third term. Building such high-coverage testing unearthed a lot of
            challenges that were super fun to solve, independently or as part of
            a pair-debugging session. Even though I made a large mistake, I used
            that as a learning experience and pushed myself to walk away as a
            better developer.

          <div class="text-body">
            Something I found incredibly difficult was the transition from
            reading and analyzing code at school versus in industry. At school,
            I was given maybe a 20-line C snippet and asked to trace and debug
            it. I understood that working in the industry would require
            analyzing and reviewing more code, but what surprised me was the
            sheer volume and breadth of code. I found it quite challenging to
            digest relatively large pull requests where I lacked all context.
            One strategy I used was to set up a consistent PR review cadence. By
            getting consistent exposure to different code from across the stack,
            I gained more valuable code base context and improved my PR
            digesting skills. Another strategy I had was to set an exact number
            of PR reviews to complete before the end of the term. This gave me a
            target to hit and lit a fire under me to get to work. In reflection,
            this strategy proved ineffective for me. Aiming for only an exact
            quantity of reviews set incorrect incentives and ambiguous
            expectations. In the end, I fell short of the target, but I
            drastically improved my code analysis skills. I feel much more
            confident digesting and analyzing large pull requests and
            understanding context before I dive in.
